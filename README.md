## Story
The Career Advisor Solution in Real World Scenario: Suppose there's a person let's say his name is Alex. Alex is a mid-level software engineer at a medium-sized tech company who is underpaid and uncertain about what to do next. Let's follow Alex's journey with Career Advisor:

Initial Evaluation and Standardization Alex begins with a simple question: "How does my salary match up with industry norms?"

Career Advisor plots Alex's current position, experience, location, and skills against comprehensive market data. It presents a graphical dashboard that shows that while Alex's base salary is at the 45th percentile, individuals with the same experience but cloud technology skills are paid 22% more on average.

Competency-Based Professional Development Inquisitive, Alex asks: "Which skills will boost my earning potential the most?"

Career Advisor analyzes current market trends and identifies three high-demand skills for Alex's career trajectory: Kubernetes orchestration, serverless architecture, and machine learning integration. The AI correlates each skill with salary growth in Alex's area and predicts potential earnings in 5 years if Alex acquires these skills.

Professional Career Simulation Ever more confident, Alex thinks of broader options: "What if I switch to DevOpsâ€”what will that do to my salary five years from now?" Career Advisor generates a dynamic career simulation that depicts multiple paths: staying in one's current job and adding skills, transitioning into a DevOps role, or moving into a leadership position. Every path includes a visualization of salary trends, key competencies, and forecasts of market demand. For the DevOps path, Career Advisor defines specific certification programs that yield the highest return on investment based on hiring trends.

Negotiation Strategy Alex says before doing anything: "What is the best way of maximizing my salary in my current employment?"

Career Advisor reviews successful negotiation patterns and offers Alex a personalized negotiation script that highlights major achievements and compensation numbers derived from market research. It recommends exact project results to highlight and predicts the optimal timing for the discussion in relation to company performance cycles.
